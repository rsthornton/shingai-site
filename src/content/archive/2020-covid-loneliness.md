Because the majority of my friends and family don't live alone as I do, I feel
it's been pretty difficult for me to relate to their experiences during this
crisis and vice-versa. Excessive loneliness has been a defining theme for me,
and there is a significant amount of academic literature being produced that
examines how humanity's response to COVID-19 is impacting loneliness and general
mental health. 

These are a few of the papers and reports I'll be going through in hopes of
gaining more insight into the nature of the problem and how these issues might
be mitigated during the current health crisis and future ones.
