The emergence of open blockchains as one of the most hyped technologies of the
past decade has led to the birth of cryptoeconomics, a discipline that combines
computer science and economics to effectively design decentralized digital
systems.

Cryptoeconomic systems [https://epub.wu.ac.at/7309/?ref=hackernoon.com] like
Bitcoin and Ethereum have proven useful for a small group of innovators and
early adopters, but how can we encourage widespread adoption of products that
the average person still doesn't see any need for?

Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller's latest book, Narrative Economics
[https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Economics-Stories-Economic-Events/dp/0691182299?ref=hackernoon.com]
, may help answer that question. Shiller advocates for the development of
empirical methods to assess the causal impact of narratives on economic
phenomena. The cryptoasset market is an ideal testbed for running experiments in
support of his ambitious research agenda. Crypto markets are global, run 24/7,
and generate vast amounts of free, open data that can be used to conduct
in-depth analyses of market dynamics and how they correlate with different
narratives.

In this piece, I'll examine four current popular narratives in crypto to
illustrate the important role they will play in mass adoption. In part two, I'll
outline a future research agenda for narrative cryptoeconomics.

Narratives in Crypto
“Bitcoin is digital gold and a potential safe haven”
While Bitcoin’s role as a potential safe haven during economic crises has been 
called into question
[https://www.coindesk.com/why-bitcoins-safe-haven-narrative-has-flown-out-the-window?ref=hackernoon.com] 
as a result of March 12th's major crash that correlated with the stock market's
plummet
[https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-no-longer-looks-like-digital-gold-by-one-measure?ref=hackernoon.com]
, it still could evolve into a safe haven of sorts under the right conditions.
BTC has recovered all of its losses since the crash and is still outperforming
the stock market for the year. If, over the next few years, bitcoin can maintain
its historically low correlation
[https://medium.com/@PanteraCapital/the-simple-case-for-investing-in-blockchain-blockchain-letter-august-2019-b38cd?ref=hackernoon.com] 
to other major assets and continue its historical trend of decreasing average
volatility [https://bitvol.info/index.html?ref=hackernoon.com], it may become
attractive as a safe haven to a significant subset of the global population. 
Surveys have indicated
[https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/bitcoin-is-a-demographic-mega-trend-data-analysis-160d2f7731e5?ref=hackernoon.com] 
that nearly 1/4th of millennials prefer Bitcoin to gold and early research
suggests that Ether
[http://www.accessecon.com/Pubs/EB/2020/Volume40/EB-20-V40-I1-P10.pdf?ref=hackernoon.com] 
could function as a safe haven.

“Open blockchains will re-decentralize the web”
As the tech titans like Google who "hijacked the web

as well as federal and state regulators

, a swarm of technologists are building potential alternatives to the
centralized platforms society has come to depend on. Ethereum
[https://ethereum.org/what-is-ethereum/?ref=hackernoon.com] enthusiasts believe
the platform will serve as the Internet's missing "value layer."
[https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/ether-is-the-best-model-for-money?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTY4NTk3LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxMjc1MjEsIl8iOiJxOTZPYSIsImlhdCI6MTU2OTAwMDIzNSwiZXhwIjoxNTY5MDAzODM1LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTEyNTkiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.4K7PphbVsI1fYkWywXTfY9uQK0rMBteXgL9s3IzYgdE&ref=hackernoon.com] 
This new layer, fueled by the cryptocurrency Ether
[https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/what-is-ether/?ref=hackernoon.com], will
support an ecosystem of new web applications built on open protocols. Web users
will no longer depend on corporate monopolists to carry out daily activities
like social networking, video streaming, and image sharing.

Instead, users will have access to open applications designed to give users
ownership and control over their data. Truly open applications also give
developers the ability to copy an application’s source code and spin up their
own improved version if they feel the existing one is flawed. This could lead to
the growth of a more competitive landscape for digital platforms where it is
more difficult for dangerous monopolists to thrive. If a new Facebook or Google
emerges and engages in dubious behavior, users will have the option to jump ship
to a high quality competitor that meets their needs.

The Ethereum ecosystem is a digital Wild West attracting technologists who would
rather ditch mainstream digital platforms and settle a new world of radical
social experiments than attempt to change the behaviors of existing tech giants
through activism or relying on regulators.

The fate of these fledgling protocols, platforms, and applications is uncertain,
but they offer a tantalizing glimpse of what the future may hold. These bold
social experiments have helped create a compelling narrative that has attracted
some of the world's brightest developers and entrepreneurs.

“Decentralized finance will revolutionize the global economy”

help large amounts of people, but the narrative that DeFi protocols can improve
our global financial system is likely to persist.

Blockchain (but not bitcoin!!!

establishment.

The Power of Narratives
A grueling battle for market dominance between government digital currencies,
corporate digital currencies, and decentralized digital currencies will take
place over the coming decades. Public blockchains will compete and co-exist with
various forms of permissioned chains. Anyone attempting to forecast long term
trends in crypto or encourage mass adoption should focus not only on technical
milestones, but also on the narratives that influence the average person's
perception of what's happening. The stories that people tell themselves and
others about the past, present, and future are important.

In the 1930’s as the world was in the grips of global economic depression,
English economist John Maynard Keynes published The General Theory of
Employment, Interest, and Money. The book kicked off the Keynesian Revolution
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_Revolution?ref=hackernoon.com] and a
dominant narrative that emerged as a result of Keynes’ work was that public
officials needed to deepen their involvement in steering markets to reduce
suffering.

This narrative proved to be much more popular and comforting than the
alternative narrative offered by adherents of the rival Austrian School of
Economics
[https://fee.org/articles/understanding-austrian-economics/?ref=hackernoon.com],
who cautioned against trying to centrally plan macroeconomic activity and
emphasized the need to let bad businesses fail during recessions. Keynesianism
went on to dominate the world of economics and still holds a pervasive influence
on mainstream economic thinking. The Austrian school is often dismissed by
mainstream economists and rarely given much credence in college economics
programs.

History suggests that it may be the most skilled and persuasive storytellers and
not the brightest engineers or most knowledgeable economists who will determine
long-term winners and losers in crypto. As humanity navigates the most severe
economic crisis since the Great Depression, it would be wise for idealistic
entrepreneurs to keep the importance of narratives in their mind while building.
