I've been gradually shifting my attention away from crypto and towards broader
interests, but I've never been more confident that crypto is here to stay.

Mainstream adoption appears to be within reach by the middle or end of the
decade. From Fortnite players experimenting with Reddit's new Ethereum-based

cryptocurrency, to rural Africans and Oregonians using a crypto-powered
community mesh Internet network
[https://decrypt.co/22421/how-althea-is-using-crypto-to-bring-internet-to-rural-communities]
, average consumers are starting to get a taste of how crypto might enhance
their every day experiences. The fact that Square's Cash App recently saw the 
majority of its quarterly revenue

come from Bitcoin sales is very promising.

Institutional adoption is laying the ground work for massive amounts of capital
to start flowing into crypto. Baseline

protocol is making it safe and easy for corporations to use public blockchains
for business operations. Bakkt is working

facilitate the use of cryptocurrency in payments for every day consumers while
providing secure storage of digital assets for institutions. Renowned hedge fund
investor Paul Tudor made a splash when he wrote a letter justifying his decision
to allocate nearly 2% of his wealth

into Bitcoin. Options

and futures contracts

make it easy for investors who don't want to deal with learning about
cryptoassets to gain exposure to the asset class. The 2017/2018 bubble was based
on pure hype and speculation and occurred without meaningful participation from
institutional investors. The next one will be qualitatively different. 

Key technical improvements are being developed at warp speed. Bitcoin's 
lightning network [https://lightning.engineering/] and sidechains (of the 
federated
[https://blockstream.com/2020/03/27/en-liquid-network-grows-to-45-members/] and 
decentralized [http://www.drivechain.info/blog/spring-contest/]variety) will
greatly increase its utility. The transition to Ethereum 2.0

will be underway soon while state channels [https://statechannels.org/], 
optimistic rollups
[https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/],
and ZK STARKs
[https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/] are 
delivering major improvements on Ethereum 1.0 [https://loopring.org/#/]. This
work might seem boring to non-enthusiasts, but it's important. Some of my
biggest fears about crypto's future revolve around technical issues: Can this
stuff scale? Will Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake be successful? Can
Bitcoin and Ethereum withstand repeated, coordinated attacks from well-funded
and sophisticated  attackers? 

Crypto plunged along with the stock market back in March but has made a
stronger, swifter recovery. On a daily basis I'm bombarded with reasons to be
optimistic about the crypto economy, something I can't say about the U.S.
economy, at least in the short to mid-term. 

I certainly wouldn't invest anything you can't afford to lose in crypto, but I
would invest a bit of time into understanding why Bitcoin hasn't died yet
