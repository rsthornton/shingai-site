I'd like to share some thoughts on Elon Musk, Twitter, and digital public
squares.

Elon Musk
Musk is fascinating and a top notch troll. The more he gets attacked by legacy
institutions, the more I'm inclined to trust him.

Electric and self-driving cars are overrated. Solar roofs, humanoid robots
[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/21/elon-musk-says-optimus-robot-will-be-worth-more-than-tesla.html]
, and space exploration technologies are more important.

I don't know enough about him to do anything other than take his stated
long-term goals
[https://www.reuters.cofm/article/us-musk-twitter-tweets-idCAKCN2MH11J] for
Twitter at face value.

Twitter
Twitter as software
Early Twitter employees envisioned it as
[https://twitter.com/blaine/status/1473401448054411266] an open software
protocol. It initially felt like [http://paulgraham.com/twitter.html] a protocol
and the code was written for it to function as one. Most innovation came
[https://twitter.com/rabble/status/1515160636288028673] from users and third
party developers, not internal teams. 

Because the software was owned by a corporation, the team optimized for the
needs of private investors, not the general public.

Twitter became a platform, not a protocol
[https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech]
.

Twitter will be more valuable to society if it can transition to being an open
client of a decentralized protocol
[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106]. Jack Dorsey launched 
Project Bluesky [https://blueskyweb.xyz/] to facilitate this transition and Musk 
appears to be aligned
[https://decrypt.co/97907/elon-musk-priorities-twitter-code-github-crack-down-crypto-spam] 
with this vision.

Twitter as corporation
Because Twitter is a closed platform owned by a private company, the
corporation's leadership has tremendous influence over the platform's social
dynamics.

https://twitter.com/jack/status/1518767238081171456By relying on ad-revenue for
monetization, Twitter's leadership has allowed the application to be victimized
by the same toxic dynamics of every major social media platform. Advertisers are
the customers while users, along with their data, are products to be sold.

The way the company has approached content moderation has not been conducive to
creating a healthy digital public square. They put too much faith in the power
[https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/28/twitter-vijaya-gadde-free-speech-policies-technology-social-media-429221] 
of top-down control
[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html] 
and restricting the flow of information
[https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/18/1012066/emtech-stage-twitters-cto-on-misinformation/]
. 

I understand the fear that would drive highly-educated individuals to embrace
this approach. I also believe it is counter-productive.

I hope Musk can help us transition to a future where the Twitter corporation is
just one of many stakeholders in a decentralized community managing an
open-source digital public good.

Digital Public Squares
Jemima Kelley of the Financial Times makes a valid point
[https://www.ft.com/content/93c17a9e-8f65-48e1-8273-c7772d6f1819] in arguing
that Twitter is more theater than public square. Still, Twitter is the only
major social network with the potential to function
[https://shingai.xyz/twitter-a-fledgling-digital-public-square/] as a digital
public square.

> First, I wanted to step back and share our view of Twitter’s role in the world.
We believe many people use Twitter as a digital public square. They gather from
all around the world to see what’s happening, and have a conversation about what
they see.

By focusing on free speech and healthy discourse Musk can help unlock Twitter's
potential.

Free speech
Twitter's "safety policies" have made me feel less safe. Starting in early 2020
I found myself increasingly engaged in self-censorship. I avoided sharing many
of my thoughts on politics and society because I didn't want to be banned.

have both the reality & the perception that they're freely able to speak within
the bounds of law" — @elonmusk

Platforms should ban illegal content, like death threats, and lobby to change
any laws they believe are unjust.

All other content should be fair game. Users should be empowered with tools to
curate their experience and avoid any legal content they can't stand being
exposed to.

I hope Musk can create a culture that is less fixated on censoring "undesirable"
speech. 

Healthy Discourse
Free speech is necessary, but not sufficient for healthy discourse. 

I don't have any grand solutions to the problem of facilitating healthy
discourse on social media. But I will share some thoughts.

 * All verified humans should get a blue check, but we should preserve the
   ability for quality pseudonymous accounts to participate in public discourse
   as equals.
 * Disinformation is real, but it is beyond naive to believe that those crying
   the loudest about its dangers aren't guilty of spreading it themselves.
   Corporations and governments will not "solve" disinformation.
 * I've had no personal experience with bigotry, racism, or hate speech on
   Twitter so it's hard for me to relate to those who fear it. I'm open to
   private conversations to learn more from people who have been directly
   impacted by these issues.
 * We should be supporting the work of researchers like Chris Bail
   [https://www.chrisbail.net/] of the Duke Polarization Lab
   [https://www.polarizationlab.com/]. Chris is engaged in important research
   that has incredible potential to help humans become more aware of their
   biases and capable of engaging in healthy debate with people "on the other
   side" of controversial issues.

If we want healthy digital public squares, we need to address the human causes
of polarization and social media dysfunction. Relying on technology to fight
symptoms by suppressing ideas has backfired.

> Agreed. Permanent ban increased division, resentment, and hate in the world, not
decreased it. It just moved it off the platform. Conversation is the only thing
we have to heal the division and celebrate our common humanity.

What I'm Watching for
I value Twitter because it helps me develop connections with like minds, closely
follow developments in fields I care about, and engage with a diversity of
perspectives on important issues. I haven't experienced this on any other social
network, so I have a vested interest in seeing Twitter thrive. 

Assuming Musk's Twitter takeover goes through, here's what I'll be watching for.

 * Can he create a healthy culture and unite the team around a common mission? 
   Running a social media platform is hard!
   [https://twitter.com/yishan/status/1514938507407421440]
 * Will he develop a healthy working relationship with the Bluesky team? I hope
   so.
 * What sort of crypto/web3 integration will we see? With crypto bullish
   institutions like A16Z, Binance, and Fidelity backing him
   [https://decrypt.co/99513/crypto-exchange-binance-back-elon-musk-twitter-bid-with-500m]
   , it's likely Musk will be encouraged to prioritize crypto. Might he actually
   airdrop a Twittercoin [https://balajis.com/elondrop/] or launch a TweeterDAO
   [https://www.notboring.co/p/if-we-ruled-the-tweets?s=r] to decentralize
   control of Twitter to the users?
 * How will he pursue
   [https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23056524/elon-musk-twitter-business-plans-charging-governments-corporations] 
   the noble goal of decreasing Twitter's reliance on ad revenue
   [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/06/technology/elon-musk-twitter-pitch-deck.html]
   ?
 * How will he handle attacks
   [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1527491436005957633] from the political
   and tech elites who don't share his perspective on free speech? 

The fact that Jack Dorsey
[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/26/jack-dorsey-elon-musk-is-the-singular-solution-for-twitter.html] 
describes Musk as the "singular solution [he] trusts to solve for the issue of
Twitter being a company" and as being on "a mission to extend the light of
consciousness" makes me cautiously optimistic about his potential to transform
Twitter for the better.
