Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are a novel form of internet-based
organization. If you are a member of any internet communities, it's worth taking
some time to learn about them. 

DAOs differentiate themselves from the online communities we're used to (ie:
subreddits, Twitter sub-graphs, Facebook groups) by giving their members a
built-in mechanism for pooling and deploying funds to achieve shared goals.

 OpenLaw co-founder Aaron Wright [https://twitter.com/awrigh01] provides a great
one-line description of DAOs –"DAOs are subreddits with bank accounts and
governance."

> DAOs are subreddits with bank accounts and governance.

Eth and Web3 will encourage positive forms of coordination, not just shitposting
and mobs.

Cooper Turley [https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa], crypto strategy lead at
Audius, provides a complimentary definition – "DAOs are internet communities
with a shared cap table and bank account."

I'm excited to see what these fledgling internet communities with shared bank
accounts end up funding and creating over the coming years.
