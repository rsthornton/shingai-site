I started using Twitter in late 2015 because it was the best way to follow
developments in crypto. Now that I'm shifting my focus away from crypto and
towards studying Systems Science [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_science]
, my needs have changed. 

I want valuable information on topics I care about, engaging conversations, and
connections that help me establish healthy community. 

In this post I'll briefly reflect on each of these goals. In a followup I'll
share thoughts on how Tweetscape [https://github.com/rooteco/tweetscape] can
support me in achieving them.

Valuable Information
Crypto twitter
[https://media.consensys.net/i-read-crypto-twitter-for-hours-everyday-here-are-40-accounts-that-really-matter-cfecc681379d] 
has been an invaluable resource, unfortunately there is no comparably active
"Systems Science Twitter" community. So I'll be spending less time absorbing
information from Twitter and more time learning from books
[https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Systems-Science-Understanding-Complex/dp/1493919199#:~:text=From%20basic%20principles%20of%20organization,the%20book%20provides%20an%20integrated]
, podcasts
[https://newbooksnetwork.com/george-e-mobus-and-michael-c-kalton-principles-of-systems-science-springer-verlag-2015]
, and conversations with Systems Science practitioners. 

I've set up several lists to optimize the time I do spend on Twitter. 

 * Systems Thinkers [https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086057467455299584] –
   Scientists, entrepreneurs, and organizations who embrace a systems
   perspective in making sense of the world
 * Political Economy [https://twitter.com/i/lists/219582486] – People whose
   perspectives on political and economic systems I value
 * Cryptogurus [https://twitter.com/i/lists/1195946586943000576] – My favorite
   thinkers and builders in crypto
 * DAOs [https://twitter.com/i/lists/1276259642285293568] – People, projects,
   organizations working on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
 * Cryptogaming [https://twitter.com/i/lists/884466365532209153] - Leaders and
   projects in a niche I sense will take off in huge way over the next few years

Interacting with lists via Tweetdeck [https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/] helps me
focus on the information I want to absorb rather than being bombarded by content
served up by Twitter's algorithm. 

Engaging Conversation
I've gotten comfortable using Twitter to learn from others and share ideas I've
spent a lot of time refining. I'd like to spend more time sharing my thoughts,
insights, and questions in real time. 

Less overthinking, more connection. 

> think an underrated key to tweeting well is low activation energy

the pattern your brain naturally arrives at without too much thought is most
likely to pass into someone elses brain with the least resistance and effort

More time replying to threads I previously would have liked or retweeted to see
what sort of interesting conversations emerge.

mutuals with good reply game

I want to learn how to play the Twitter RPG

well. 

> With a little introspection, Twitter can be a tool for self-inquiry, making
friends, testing ideas, messing around, finding information, practicing speech,
and pretty much anything you like.

It’s also, like everything else, just a game.

Have fun!

Healthy Community
Engaging in more conversations will support one of my main goals – finding a
community of like minds that can support me as I study systems science. My goal
is to follow Nadia Asparouhova's [https://twitter.com/nayafia] path of 
independent research [https://nadia.xyz/independent-research] and creating my
own PhD [https://nadia.xyz/phd] program.

This will require mentors and community – the solo approach I took to learning
about crypto isn't well-suited for studying systems science. Most of my work
will take place away from Twitter, but I know that the platform, wielded
properly, can help.

I'll share thoughts on how Tweetscape could become my go to Twitter interface in
a future post.
