Introduction
I believe Twitter is one of humanity’s most powerful available tools for
overcoming our information crisis.

Our shared sources of truth are disintegrating as trust in traditional
institutions crumbles. We are losing the ability to agree on basic facts just as
we are becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent. 

We need a functional digital public square in order to safely navigate the
information age.

In this post I’ll examine four trends in the Twitter ecosystem to paint a
picture of the platform's current state, and where it's headed.

 1. Twitter as digital public square

 2. Monetization woes
 3. Polarization and Mis/disinformation struggles
 4. The rise of Twitter alternatives

The next post will discuss how Twitter's "bluesky
[https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1204766347512537088]," an open-source
decentralized protocol for social media, can transform it into a healthier
digital public square.

Twitter’s Past and Present 

#1 Twitter as Public Square
Liberal democracies, the least horrible form of government humanity has created
thus far, can't function if their populations aren't able to form consensus on
key issues. Consensus formation requires open debate.

Twitter's mission
[https://investor.twitterinc.com/contact/faq/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20mission%20we%20serve%20as,a%20free%20and%20global%20conversation.] 
– to "give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information
instantly without barriers," is perfectly aligned with the ideals of liberal
democracy. 

The platform's design makes it uniquely positioned among major social networks
to serve as a forum for discussion about local, national, and global issues. 

 * Facebook confines us to small networks of family and friends.
 * Instagram, Snapchat, and Youtube aren’t designed to facilitate meaningful
   conversations within and across diverse communities.
 * Reddit has the right structure, but the prevalence of pseudonymous accounts
   makes it poorly suited for the job.

At 330 million monthly active users
[https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/]
, Twitter has built a solid foundation for a digital public square. 

 * Research indicates Twitter is less harmful for mental health
   [https://www.rsph.org.uk/static/uploaded/d125b27c-0b62-41c5-a2c0155a8887cd01.pdf] 
   than most other social media. 
 * The average Twitter user is surprisingly moderate
   [https://www.bu.edu/questrom/2018/11/26/why-twitter-isnt-the-echo-chamber-you-think-it-is] 
   and exposed to a diverse array of information.
 * Twitter is working to measure and increase conversational health
   [https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/measuring_healthy_conversation.html] 
   by promoting the acknowledgment of diverse viewpoints, and differentiating
   between incivility (which can be helpful) and intolerance (which is
   inherently dangerous to democracy).
 * Upcoming features such as Facebook style groups ("Communities
   [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers]
   ") and Clubhouse style audio chat rooms ("Spaces"
   [https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1370026897808179200]) will enhance the
   experience for existing users, make it more attractive to newcomers, and help
   it "feel" more like a public square. 

#2 Monetization Woes
Despite the platform’s growth, Twitter faces significant business challenges. Ad
revenue, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of income, is declining
[https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241974/twitter-q1-2020-earnings-coronavirus-mdau-growth-ad-revenue]
. Twitter operated at a net loss in 2020
[https://www.yahoo.com/now/twitter-announces-fourth-quarter-fiscal-210500025.html]
, and its stock price has chronically underperformed rivals such as Facebook and
Snapchat. 

The company has recently made important moves towards Passion Economy
[https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/] style monetization. “Super
follows
[https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/]
” will allow users to charge their followers for access to extra content such as
private communities, bonus tweets, and subscriptions to newsletters
[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html]
. Twitter's acquisition of Revue
[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html] 
will enable them to attempt competition with Substack. 

Twitter will boost revenue by taking a cut from each transaction enabled by
these new services, thereby reducing its reliance on advertisements.

#3 Polarization and Mis/disinformation struggles
Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey has been called to testify in front of the U.S.
Congress multiple times and is stuck in a no-win situation. Democrats accuse
Twitter of allowing dangerous misinformation to spread
[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/18/house-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google/]
, while Republicans claim the company is engaged in politically motivated
censorship
[https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/17/facebook-twitter-dorsey-zuckerberg-donald-trump-conservative-bias-antitrust/6317585002/]
. 

Political pressure in the wake of a contested U.S. Presidential election and the
Jan. 6th storming of the Capitol made banning Donald Trump for his alleged role
in spreading disinformation that led to violence a logical short-term move.
Business would have suffered had they not made the call. 

But even anti-Trumpers such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Trump’s
eviction from Twitter “problematic,”
[https://apnews.com/article/merkel-trump-twitter-problematic-dc9732268493a8ac337e03159f0dc1c9] 
and Twitter may be considering
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-considers-starting-social-media-163531718.html] 
allowing Trump back on the platform. Dorsey acknowledged that banning Trump was
a difficult decision that reflected Twitter's failure to promote healthy
conversation.

> Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us.
They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a
precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a
part of the global public conversation.

The reality is that our misinformation/disinformation crisis is merely a symptom
of a much larger issue – the chronic lack of trust
[https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/09/14/americans-views-of-government-low-trust-but-some-positive-performance-ratings/] 
in our decaying social institutions. A populace which does not trust
[https://www.axios.com/media-trust-crisis-2bf0ec1c-00c0-4901-9069-e26b21c283a9.html] 
the corporate press (often with good reason
[https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/weapons-mass-destruction-and-media-anatomy-failure]
) along with mainstream science or the education system, will inevitably look to
"alternative sources" to make sense of the world. 

Pew Research Center
[https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/09/14/americans-views-of-government-low-trust-but-some-positive-performance-ratings/]
Twitter can not fulfill its mission if it continues making millions feel
persecuted, driving them to self-censor and seek haven in isolated
echo-chambers. Deplatforming, censorship, and ridicule of those with different
perspectives merely accelerates the loss of trust in institutions. The apparent 
dominance of the left
[https://knightfoundation.org/articles/polarization-in-the-twittersphere-what-86-million-tweets-reveal-about-the-political-makeup-of-american-twitter-users-and-how-they-engage-with-news/] 
on Twitter limits its potential to facilitate healthy debate.

[https://knightfoundation.org/articles/polarization-in-the-twittersphere-what-86-million-tweets-reveal-about-the-political-makeup-of-american-twitter-users-and-how-they-engage-with-news/]
Twitter should develop tools that help us engage in meaningful discussion with
our ideological opponents. Eric Weinstein, a Bernie Sanders supporting "Never
Trumper" who works for a former Trump-supporter (Peter Thiel
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU5TIKTZzk4]), has consistently demonstrated
that there is demand for nuanced perspectives on the polarizing issues of our
time. 

> C) The media was good calling out all the really bad things Trump did.

D) The media was bad calling out any positive thing Trump said or did and
painted him evil.

E) Journalists in 2020 & 2016 unethically became activists misreporting a big
blue wave or Hilary’s inevitable win.

#4 The Rise of Twitter Alternatives
In response to Twitter’s deplatforming spree
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalentertainment/2021/01/28/amazon-and-twitter-deplatforming-parler-and-trump-is-it-legal/?sh=435066cb7d25]
, there’s been a surge of interest in alternative platforms. 

 * Gab and Parler
   [https://fortune.com/2021/01/11/mewe-gab-rumble-growth-parler-trump-bans-social-media-violence/] 
   have become a safe haven for conservatives, Trump supporters, and “conspiracy
   theorists.” 
 * Former President Donald Trump will be launching his own social media platform
   [https://news.yahoo.com/trump-plans-social-media-return-173128094.html] 
   within the next few months. 
 * Bitcoiners are setting up a base [https://bitcoinhackers.org/about/more] on
   the open-source platform Mastodon
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)].
 * Capsule [https://capsule.social/] is building “decentralized social media
   that just works” with support from crypto/tech juggernauts including Balaji
   Srinivisan, Castle Island Ventures
   [https://www.coindesk.com/nic-carters-castle-island-ventures-closes-50m-investment-fund]
   , and Polychain Capital [https://polychain.capital/].
 * Ethereum-powered Minds
   [https://decrypt.co/60668/ethereum-based-social-network-minds-taps-into-defi-rewards]
   , with a strong focus on free speech and algorithmic transparency, boasted 3
   million monthly users in 2020. 
 * Crypto social network BitClout [https://bitclout.com/] (a potentially 
   perfect
   case study
   [https://decrypt.co/62770/inside-bitclout-dystopian-social-network-big-investors-vocal-critics] 
   of how not to launch a decentralized social network) has high-profile backers
   [https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/crypto-social-network-bitclout-arrives-with-a-bevy-of-high-profile-investors-and-skeptics/] 
   including Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital, Winklevoss Capital, and Reddit
   co-founder Alexis Ohanian.

Network effects will keep Twitter safe for a while, but in the absence of a
paradigm shift in the company's approach to content moderation, the demand for
alternatives will rise. Its potential to act as a space for discussion between
groups with diverse viewpoints will disintegrate as people retreat to the safety
of their echo chambers. 


Why Twitter’s Fate Matters
Twitter is approaching a tipping point.

It will either become exponentially more useful and influential, or it will
stagnate, deteriorate, and become increasingly dysfunctional in its role as
digital public square. 

As the most prominent digital space where world leaders, tech CEOs, celebrity
influencers, and the average citizen can all engage in meaningful interactions
with each other, the platform can not be ignored. It is the closest we have to a
functional and highly scalable digital public square, and it is in our
collective best interest to work towards shaping it into a healthier space.

My next post will explore how bluesky can help transform Twitter, and the
broader social media ecosystem, for the better.
