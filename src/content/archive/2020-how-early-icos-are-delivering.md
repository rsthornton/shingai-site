One popular narrative about 2017's ICO mania
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/07/10/the-emperors-new-coins-how-initial-coin-offerings-fueled-a-100-billion-crypto-bubble/#246dc7db6ece] 
says it was fueled by naive investors duped into throwing money at projects that
were either incapable or had no intention, of delivering. The utopian vision of
crowdfunding capital for the development of open-source software platforms by
selling crypto-assets was a dangerous pipe dream.

There is plenty of truth in this narrative, but the other side of the story
often gets overlooked. The teams behind several ambitious projects have been
heads down coding, shipping, and maintaining transparent communications about
their work for several years. Those who purchased tokens to support these
projects have experienced some staggering returns. Because of their high
risk-tolerance, the global public is gaining access to a powerful suite of
Ethereum-based protocols and applications. 

Augur [https://www.augur.net/] raised $5.2 million in ~1.5 months
[https://icorating.com/ico/augur-rep/] in 2015 to build the world's first
decentralized prediction market, a betting platform where anyone can buy or sell
shares representing the outcome of any event, and share prices reflect realistic
probabilities that events will occur. Augur V1 was a functional proof-of-concept
that was never expected to gain much mainstream traction. V2 just went live and
introduces several improvements [https://www.augur.net/faq/#what-is-reputation] 
designed to increase adoption. Augur's REP token
[https://www.augur.net/faq/#what-is-reputation] holders can earn a portion of
market settlement fees by correctly reporting on event outcomes. 

Gnosis [https://gnosis.io/] raised $12.5 million in 12 minutes
[https://icorating.com/ico/gnosis-gno/] in 2017 to develop an alternative
decentralized prediction market protocol. The Gnosis team focused on building
tools for developers rather than delivering their own globally accessible
applications. Live prediction markets like Omen [https://omen.eth.link/], 
Polymarket [https://poly.market/discover], and Sight [https://sight.pm/] 
demonstrate the power and flexibility of Gnosis' Conditional Token Framework
[https://docs.gnosis.io/conditionaltokens/]. The GNO token
[https://gnosis.io/tokens] is used to generate OWL tokens which are used to pay
fees on Gnosis-based platforms. 

0x [https://0x.org/]raised $24 million [https://icorating.com/ico/0x-project/] 
in a day in August 2017 to build a protocol for decentralized exchange of ERC-20
tokens. The 0X network has generated $1.5 billion in trading volume, 1.55
million trades, attracted 41.44k active traders, and collected $124k in
protocol
fees [https://0xtracker.com/network-insights] from traders. The team has also
deployed a user-friendly crypto trading application, Matcha
[https://matcha.xyz/]. The ZRX token can be staked [https://0x.org/zrx/staking] 
to earn a portion of protocol fees and also be used to vote
[https://0x.org/zrx/vote] on 0x improvement proposals (ZEIPs). 

Kyber [https://kyber.network/] raised $48 million
[https://icorating.com/ico/kybernetwork-knc/] in a day in 2017 to build a
decentralized exchange and payment service. The Kyber Network has facilitated 
over $1 billion
[https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-ecosystem-report-15-f5c7dca5d713] in trading
volume from over 84,000 unique addresses, collected ~1,500 ETH in fees, and
successfully transitioned to ownership by DAO [https://kyber.org/about]. The
KNC
token [https://kyber.network/about/knc] can be used to earn a portion of
collected ETH fees by voting on the Kyber Network's key parameters.

Golem [https://golem.network/] raised $8 million
[https://icorating.com/ico/golem-gnt/] in 29 minutes in 2016 to build a
decentralized global supercomputer that allows anyone to sell computing time
over the web. The Golem network currently boasts
[https://stats.golem.network/ui/] 112 nodes, 826 CPU cores, 1.46 TiB of RAM, and
16.80 TiB of Disk space. Golem has secured partnerships with the likes of 
Intel,
Texas A&M, and UNC
[https://blog.golemproject.net/graphene-golem-intel-itl-and-founders-of-the-project-establish-a-working-group-towards-cutting-edge-technology-development/]
. The GNT token [https://docs.golem.network/#/About/Payments] is used to rent
computing power on the Golem network.

Melon [https://melonprotocol.com/] raised $2.9 million in a month in 2017
[https://icorating.com/ico/melonport-mln/] to build an asset management protocol
that allows anyone to set up or invest in a transparent, smart contract-based
investment fund. Melon currently has 357 funds, 416 investors, and ~$1.3
million
in total assets under management [https://monitoring.melon.network/]. The team
has also delivered on their promise to hand control of the protocol over to a
DAO
[https://medium.com/melonprotocol/the-melon-dao-past-present-and-future-69d7827c668f]
. The MLN token [https://melonprotocol.com/docs/melonomics/] is used as "asset
management gas", collected and burned by the protocol when users set up or
invest in funds, and when fund managers claim fees. 

Yes, the majority of ICOs were duds and the mania attracted fraudsters along
with overly ambitious teams. Similar dynamics exist in the world of venture
capital and startups
[https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1010/top-6-reasons-new-businesses-fail.aspx#citation-2] 
where ~90%
[https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/03/startup-statistics-small-business.html] of
businesses eventually fail. It would be a mistake to focus solely on the
failures of the first ICO wave. The speculative mania helped support radical
innovation from capable teams who are responsibly using their crowdfunded
treasuries to build sophisticated infrastructure for open and permissionless
global finance.

Disclosure: I participated in the Augur, Gnosis, and Golem ICOs. I hold ZRX and
MLN.
