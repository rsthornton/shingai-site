I grew up in Los Altos, California. As a child, I was passionate about history, science-fiction, economics, journalism, current events, and gaming. I went to the University of Southern California where I switched majors a few times (undeclared - > International Relations - > Psychology) before settling on an interdisciplinary degree - a B.A. in the Social Sciences (emphasis Psychology).

After graduating from USC in 2012, I immersed myself in the early cryptocurrency ecosystem, obsessively following developments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, various altcoins, early DAOs and DeFi because I felt open blockchains represented the most interesting and potentially liberating technology on the planet. I was fortunate enough to be able to pursue my research interests without traditional constraints of academia.

By 2017-18, I began questioning the extent to which crypto adoption would be sufficient for addressing the issues related to economic and political freedom that I assumed it would address. This led me to shift my focus towards my interest in systems science, an intellectual fascination that was catalyzed by works like Donella Meadows' Thinking in Systems and George Mobus' Principles of Systems Science.

I eventually started a newsletter, System Explorers that was published on a weekly basis from Spring 2023-Spring 2025. I'm taking a break, but will be rebooting the project later this year. I started an M.S. in Systems Science at Binghamton University in Fall of 2023 which I'll be wrapping up in the fall.

Currently, I'm most interested in how the various "systems sciences" (complexity science, cybernetics, network science, etc.) can be formally integrated in a way that grounds them in common theoretical foundations and makes their methods more broadly accessible.
