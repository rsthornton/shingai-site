Lists can help solve some of Twitter's major pain points


"Unfollowing everyone on Twitter and switching to lists for better control of my
feed. Nothing personal, love you all! " - Github CEO Nat Friedman 9/19/20
[https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1307412289620865026?s=03]

Twitter is my favorite social network. 

It is a treasure trove of enlightening blog posts, news articles, research
papers [https://twitter.com/EmorieBeck/status/1303800700829392902], and video
content that I would never see in the stagnant echo chamber
[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2795110] that is my
Facebook news feed; a place filled with content posted primarily by former
classmates who seem to have frighteningly homogenous political opinions and
little apparent interest in seriously engaging with opposing viewpoints. 

On Twitter, I have the freedom to engage with a heterogeneous network of
thinkers from diverse geographical and ideological backgrounds. The platform has
vast untapped potential as a tool for research as well as monitoring current
events and trends. A 2018 study
[https://www.bu.edu/questrom/2018/11/26/why-twitter-isnt-the-echo-chamber-you-think-it-is/] 
found compelling evidence [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06795.pdf] that Twitter
isn't very polarized. Average users are exposed to a diverse range of ideas and
post content that is more politically moderate than what they receive in their
feeds.

Unfortunately, the abundance
[https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1307693230352478209] of content comes at
a high psychological cost:

 * Information overload
   [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-020-09314-9] makes me feel
   like I'm drowning as I navigate an infinite array of never-ending newsfeeds.
   Finding the signal that I'm searching for in a sea of noise takes work. 
 * Fear [https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/22/1/1/3976922] of missing
   [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217310629]out
   [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217310629] and 
   fear of not knowing
   [https://blog.twitter.com/en_ca/topics/insights/2018/FONK_is_the_new_FOMO.html] 
   compel me to constantly check the application for anything important I may
   have missed. "Just one more refresh, just a bit more scrolling..."

Twitter lists [https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists] are an
under-appreciated feature that can increase the platform's potential to
facilitate productive social discourse. They help address existing issues by:

 * Allowing for the creation of multiple newsfeeds with content from personally
   curated groups of users, thus reducing information overload. Using Tweetdeck
   [https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/] to manage lists provides a much smoother
   Twitter user experience. 
 * Providing raw data, via the Twitter API
   [https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/get-lists-list]
   , that can be used in applications that push relevant content to users and
   reduce the amount of time they spend searching and scrolling. 

Lists have helped satisfy my craving for nuanced political and economic
discourse that transcends the left/right paradigm
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left%E2%80%93right_paradigm_political_theory] 
and focuses [https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1251634412334141440?lang=en] on 
addressing [https://twitter.com/palladiummag/status/1255916200275529728] 
systemic issues [https://twitter.com/C4COMPUTATION/status/1296806626041556995] 
rather than proposing simplistic band-aid solutions. They also help me
effectively track technical, social, and cultural developments in the rapidly
evolving crypto industry. 

Twitter could become a vital part of the digital public square with the help of
well-curated lists and better ways of interacting with them. It could help
citizens fulfill their obligation to be well informed
[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/60.html] and perhaps even allow us to
escape the bubbles of groupthink that social media has trapped us in. 

Jack Dorsey recently announced
[https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-blockchain-strategy-oslo-freedom-forum] 
plans to transform Twitter into an open decentralized platform by using public
blockchains to put users in control of their data. This shift will open up new
possibilities in terms of what sorts of applications could be built using lists
and drastically increase Twitter's potential to serve the common good.
