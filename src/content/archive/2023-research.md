My current research interests lie at the intersection of general systems theory, systems science, and the development of systems technologies.














Theory
Foundational concepts and philosophy




Science
Real-world analysis




Technology
Tools and software




BERT








Theory

 * Formal System Ontologies


Science

 * A Deep Systems Analysis of Bitcoin (working paper)


Technology

 * BERT — The Bounded Entity Reasoning Toolbox


Research Philosophy

 1. Systems research must be humanistic – humans are not machines.
 2. Systems research should effectively synthesize holistic and reductionist perspectives while maintaining rigor and flexibility.
 3. Systems researchers should appreciate the philosophical and theoretical insights of early pioneers while making use of modern computational techniques and scientific advances.
 4. Systems researchers should aim to solve practical transdisciplinary problems to help inform the process of theoretical development.
