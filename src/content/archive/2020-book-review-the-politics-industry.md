Unraveling the Dysfunctional Nature of Competition in U.S. Politics


As Election Day approaches, an all-too-familiar sense of dread creeps into my
mind. An underwhelming just over half of American voters
[https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/02/19/knight-nonvoter-study-decoding-2020-election-wild-card-115796] 
are engaged in early voting or preparing to head to the polls, while my social
media feeds overflow with anxious posts. Many people are filled with vitriolic
hatred for President Trump while others are terrified of what might happen if he
is removed from office. Activists

, police departments
[https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/13/us/nypd-election-protest-deployment/index.html],
and businesses
[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-retail-security-focus/u-s-retailers-secure-stores-as-worries-about-election-unrest-mount-idUSKBN27618Z] 
are preparing for mass protests and potential violence in the election’s
aftermath. I find myself wondering: is there anything citizens like myself can
do to help reverse our country’s accelerating slide into chaotic dysfunction?

Katherine Gehl and Michael Porter offer a comforting answer in their book The
Politics Industry: How Political Innovation Can Break Partisan Gridlock and
Save
Our Democracy
[https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Industry-Political-Innovation-Democracy/dp/1633699234]
. Gehl (a former Democrat turned Independent) and Porter (a lifelong Republican
economist) crossed paths in 2013 when Gehl asked Porter to consult on her food
manufacturing company’s strategy. Their partnership led Gehl to the realization
that Porter’s work on business competition could be used to demystify, and
eventually fix American politics. 

The duo demonstrate that Americans are not, in fact, powerless in the face of
our broken political system. Seeking the root cause of our political system’s
failure, they find that our problem is not the Republican Party or the
Democratic Party. It isn’t Donald Trump or Joe Biden. It is the fact that we’ve
allowed a toxic duopoly to gain nearly complete control over the mechanisms of
our government. The authors offer a clear roadmap with practical solutions —
with innovative analytical frameworks, captivating history lessons, and a bold
yet practical vision for reform. Overall, The Politics Industry provides a
much-needed dose of optimism in troubling times.

The authors’ main focus is on fixing the electoral and legislative machinery of
Congress — an area they consider to be at “the sweet spot of powerful and
achievable.” The Founding Fathers designed Congress to be the first and most
powerful branch of the US government, as clearly established in Article 1
[https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/article-i/clauses/749] 
of the Constitution. It therefore represents a more logical place to focus
efforts for systemic reform than the Presidency. In their analysis, they apply 
Porter's Five Forces Framework
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%27s_five_forces_analysis] to American
politics. The framework was originally designed for analyzing business
competition, but politics has become big business — about $100 billion per
election cycle. The authors assess that American politics is effectively "a
multi-billion dollar private industry within a public institution,” which is not
good for democracy. Our two political parties have become a nearly untouchable 
duopoly [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duopoly] — the root cause of our
political dysfunction.

In any other industry, independent regulators would scrutinize such a powerful
duopoly. Unfortunately, the duopoly controls the regulatory agencies (the FEC)
and non-profit corporations (The Commission on Presidential Debates) tasked with
oversight of key political processes. This makes politics “the only major
industry in America where rivals write their own rules virtually unchecked.” The
results are as follows:

 1. The two parties have crafted rules around elections and fundraising that
    make it nearly impossible for third parties and independents to compete.
 2. This duopoly forces voters into warring camps, leaving no room for the 42%
    of Americans who identify as independent
    [https://news.gallup.com/poll/245801/americans-continue-embrace-political-independence.aspx]
    .
 3. The winners of the duopoly are hyper-partisan primary voters, special
    interests, and donors.
 4. The two parties have managed to co-opt most of the key channels for
    information distribution.
 5. Suppliers of ideas have been similarly limited. Candidates, campaign
    managers, lobbyists, think tanks and academics must become aligned with one
    of the two parties in order to thrive in the politics industry.

Political parties work much like big business when it comes to competition

This system leaves out nearly half of American citizens. A silent majority
doesn’t fit in with either party and has no reasonable means for influencing
political outcomes. How can our “democratic” republic possibly be expected to
function properly?


As political parties polarize, 42% of voters identify as Independent


Gehl and Porter suggest that looking to the past can offer valuable insights for
addressing modern dysfunction. At the turn of the 20th century, a toxic duopoly
left the government incapable of solving problems for average citizens. In
response, a non-partisan, grassroots Progressive movement
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era] enacted significant systemic
reforms over the course of a few decades. Election rules were changed so that
reform-minded candidates could be elected. Progressives fought for ballot
reform, direct primaries, direct democracy, and the direct election of senators.
These electoral changes cleared the way for major reforms that made Congress
more effective and established norms for regulating money in politics. Without
these reforms, we likely would not have Social Security, Medicare, the Federal
Trade Commission, or reporting requirements for political donors.

Though the era of Progressive reform resulted in a sharp decline in polarization
within Congress, reaching historically low levels in the 1940s, the system has
since regressed. A bipartisan dismantling of congressional rules and norms
started in the 1970's under Democratic leadership and was finalized during
Republican Newt Gingrich's reign as speaker of the house in the ‘90s. A century
after the era of ambitious reform, we find ourselves paralytically polarized
once again. We see the impact of excessive polarization every day on TV, social
media, in our interactions with friends, loved ones, and political adversaries.
Democracy is in decline as Congress can’t deliver compromise or meaningful
solutions. The national debt skyrockets while our economic competitiveness
deteriorates.

Political polarization poses a grave threat to our democracy

Three ambitious reforms, Gehl and Porter advocate, would break up the duopoly
and give voters the power to put quality candidates into Congress, a body which
is supposed to represent the public but currently has an abysmal 17% approval
rating [https://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx]:

 1. Final Five voting would change the structure of the primary elections. In a
    "top-five" primary, there would no longer be separate Democratic or
    Republican primaries. Instead, voters of any political affiliation would be
    free to participate in a single non-partisan primary open to candidates from
    any party along with independents. This would create a broader, more
    competitive field in general elections. Reformers in Washington
    [https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-washington-state-top-two-primary/] 
    and California
    [http://schwarzenegger.usc.edu/institute-in-action/article/californias-top-two-primary-a-successful-reform] 
    have already made small steps in this direction by implementing "top-two"
    voting.
 2. Ranked choice voting (RCV) would replace the current dominant system of
    "winner take all" voting. Instead of being forced to choose a single
    candidate, voters would instead rank every candidate on the ballot according
    to their personal preference. Rather than being able to win an election by
    simply getting the most votes, candidates would need a majority (>50%) of
    votes to be declared winner. RCV reduces the incentives for negative
    campaigning and dividing voters, and eliminates the possibility of
    undemocratic situations where a majority of voters do not support the
    winner. Maine
    [https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/11/10/reverse-degradation-politics/] 
    has been using RCV for the U.S. House and Senate elections since 2018.
    Massachusetts voters will be given the option to adopt the system
    [https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/23/metro/should-massachusetts-institute-ranked-choice-voting-system/] 
    this November.
 3. An independent, non-partisan Legislative Machinery Innovation Commission can
    be established to reform Congress for the better. The commission would have
    a mandate of designing a "model modern legislature built to produce real
    results by adopting the best practices for state-of-the-state negotiation,
    communication, and problem solving.” Congress’ past successes in self-reform
    [https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/The-Legislative-Reorganization-Act-of-1946/] 
    serve as proof that it could work in the future.

These solutions represent an important first step towards designing a healthier
political system. They will give voters more choice, introduce incentives that
allow for healthier competitive dynamics, and set up infrastructure that will
help us implement the systemic reforms so desperately needed. Of course, there
is more work to be done. News media, public education, and social media networks
also need reform to meet the challenges of the 21st century. And electoral and
legislative reform won't help in the absence

of

a well-informed public [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/60.html]

Though it doesn’t offer a panacea, The Politics Industry is nonetheless a book
that belongs in every American household. If you consider yourself a concerned
citizen and want to find ways to address political dysfunction and toxic
partisanship in the United States, it’s a must-read. We must stop fixating on
personalities and specific policies and start engaging in systemic reform.
