As I shift from observing DAOs to actively participating in them, I'm interested
in finding tools that will help me do so efficiently. 

Boardroom [https://www.boardroom.info/], a web application which "facilitates
simple and transparent stakeholder oversight and management of DAOs," appears to
be best product the market has to offer. 

Boardoom's homescreen features a dashboard [https://app.boardroom.info/] with
information about upcoming proposals and voting history across all DAOs. There
are also links to content from Boardroom's (very informative) podcast and
newsletter, and a feed with the user's personal voting history. 

The screener page [https://app.boardroom.info/screener] features key metrics for
the DAO ecosystem such as total assets under management and number of voters
across all DAOs along with detailed information for individual DAOs. 

For my purposes, the projects [https://app.boardroom.info/projects] section is
where the magic happens. I'm presented with a screen where I can see all DAOs
supported by Boardroom and can add favorites by clicking a star. 

I've just claimed my FOX tokens from the recent Shapeshift airdrop
[https://shapeshift.com/shapeshift-decentralize-airdrop] and am eager to get
involved with Shapeshift DAO so I navigate to their page. From a single location
I now have access to: 

 * A high-level description of ShapeShift DAO's mission, governance parameters,
   and organizational structure
 * The DAO's Discourse based discussion forums neatly integrated into the
   Boardroom interface
 * An ideation page where ideas can be discussed before being crafted into
   official proposals
 * A page where I can create and vote on proposals via Snapshot
   [https://snapshot.org/] and see a list of voters
 * A treasury page where I can see the DAO's current holdings, transaction
   history, and a list of people registered to receive payouts from the treasury

There's one active proposal being considered by the DAO. After reading the
proposal and checking out the discussion on the forums, I've decided I want to
support it and can vote "Yes" with a couple button clicks. 

Boardroom is a powerful tool for anyone participating in multiple DAOs – an easy
to use portal where monitoring, discussion and voting all take place from a
single interface.

The team is adding new DAOs, features, and integrations at a rapid pace and I
can easily see it becoming a standard part of my daily workflow. I'd highly
recommend it to other DAO voters.

(Note: One feature I'd love to see implemented is a filter on the dashboard
which allows me to only see proposals from DAOs I've favorited.)
