Many of my goals for 2020 changed because of Covid-19 and lockdowns, but one
sacred resolution remained intact– I published one piece of writing each month.
This exercise taught me some valuable lessons. 

I learned that writing for yourself, not for others, can be simultaneously
empowering and limiting. I also learned that good editors are priceless and hard
to find–if you find one, you should strive to keep them in your life. 

My resolutions for 2019 (read a book every month) and 2020 (publish an article
each month) were relatively simple and self-centered. I have a broader set of
goals for 2021 that includes: 

 * Thrive in the Roote Fellowship [https://www.roote.co/]
 * Thrive in Introduction to Complexity and Applied Complexity
   [https://appliedcomplexity.io/education]
 * Complete Learn Python The Hard Way [https://learnpythonthehardway.org/]
 * Complete Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python
   [https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html]
 * Build a model in CadCAD [https://cadcad.org/]

I'll still be writing in 2021, but not on a monthly basis. I'll only publish
when I have something important to say.
