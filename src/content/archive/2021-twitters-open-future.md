Bluesky [https://twitter.com/bluesky], an open-source protocol for social media 
being funded by Twitter [https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106],
holds enormous potential to help fix our broken social media ecosystem.

Social media platforms are the public squares of the information age
[https://shingaithornton.com/twitter-a-fledgling-digital-public-square/].
Unfortunately, the dominant applications bring out the worst aspects of humanity
while suppressing our strengths. Individually, we can mitigate the downsides –
through breaks like dopamine fasts. Collectively, we have become dependent on
social media. There is no turning back. 

Designing healthier social media is a requirement for the rapid, complex
collaboration needed to tackle the major issues of our time such as reforming
democracy, protecting the environment, developing safe AI. 

This post will explain how Bluesky could help.

How Open Protocols Birthed the Web


To understand how an open protocol can fix social media
[https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech]
, we'll need a brief history lesson. 

Protocols are shared languages for computers. Technical standards released as
public infrastructure, not owned by any single party. Anyone can examine exactly
how they work, build products and applications on top of them, or modify them
without permission. 

The TCP/IP protocol, developed thanks to research from DARPA in the late 1960s,
specified a standard method for networked computers to communicate with each
other. It is the foundation for the Internet. Because it is a shared protocol,
Dell computers, HP computers, and Apple computers can communicate with each
other over the Internet.

The SMTP protocol, created in 1981, is a protocol for electronic mail
transmission. Users of Gmail, Yahoo mail, and Hotmail, can communicate with each
other because they all use SMTP.

The HTTP protocol, developed in 1989, is the foundation for the World Wide Web.
Users of Chrome, Firefox, and Brave can interact on a shared web because they
operate on a shared protocol.

What is the TCP/IP Stack
[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-tcpip-stack-phillip-zito/]There is no
widely-adopted protocol for social media. Instead, corporations use proprietary
technology to build private walled gardens. Users of Facebook, Twitter, Reddit,
Instagram and Youtube can not easily communicate with each other. Moving to a
new social network carries enormous switching costs–much larger than the costs
associated with switching computers, email providers, or web browsers. 

Collaboration, shared standards, healthy competition, and open access allowed
the internet and email to flourish. Developers building new social platforms
don't benefit from these useful dynamics. 

We need a protocol for social.

Benefits of a Social Media Protocol
> "...I believe [Bluesky] is so fundamental to our future. I believe it's so
fundamental to the Internet, and we're working as fast as we can to get there. I
hope we can get to a prototype stage within the next few years that Twitter,
Inc. can actually use and contribute to." – Jack Dorsey
[https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_downloads/2021/02/Twitter-Analyst-Day-2021-Transcript.pdf]
Dorsey has highlighted four benefits of building a protocol for social media.
Three in recent testimony to the U.S. Congress
[https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting]
: greater transparency, innovation and collaboration. A fourth,
censorship-resistance, during an interview at the 2021 Bitcoin Miami conference
[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-interview].

> We’ve started work on such a standard, which we call @bluesky
[https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]. It intends to act as a
decentralized open source social media protocol, not owned by any single company
or organization. Any developer around the world can help develop it, just as any
company can access its services.

#1 Transparency


Open protocols replace trust in companies with trust in code. A protocol for
social media would make it easier to develop applications that give greater
transparency into how user data is being stored. It would facilitate the
development of tools that give more transparency into what is happening in
online spaces. Core flaws and vulnerabilities in open social applications could
be identified quickly and discussed in public. 

#2 Innovation


An open protocol would increase innovation
[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375126827761463300] in a few key areas. 

 1. Experimentation with business models will help us replace the ad-based model
    which forces companies to optimize for monopolizing users' attention rather
    than improving their well-being. Micropayments, blockchain-based
    tokenization
    [https://consensys.net/blog/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-reddits-new-blockchain-based-community-points/]
    , and private opt-in ads
    [https://brave.com/static-assets/files/Engaging-With-Ad-Choosers.pdf] are
    promising alternative monetization models that we'll be able to explore.
    Dorsey has confirmed [https://twitter.com/jack/status/1403174877444587523] 
    that Bitcoin-based payments via the Lightning Network are on the roadmap for
    Twitter/Bluesky.
 2. Experimentation with recommendation algorithms will help us develop
    algorithms that aim to increase user well-being, not corporate revenues.
    Dorsey envisions an "open marketplace of algorithms
    [https://twitter.com/jack/status/1321456610158370817]" where users are free
    to choose the ones that best meet their personal needs. Twitter's 
    Responsible Machine Learning Initiative
    [https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-responsible-machine-learning-initiative.html] 
    represents a significant step towards building this future. 
 3. Experimentation with moderation controls will help us address the fact that
    centralized moderation doesn't scale
    [https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766082206011393], it places too great
    a
    burden
    [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/12/facebook-content-moderator-ptsd/] 
    on small groups of people. Reddit and Mastadon are good examples of
    decentralized approaches that delegate the responsibility of moderation to
    communities. Twitter's new Birdwatch
    [https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html] 
    system "allows people to identify information in Tweets they believe is
    misleading and write notes that provide informative context." The project is
    in its pilot phase with code
    [https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/ranking-notes/] and data
    [https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/contributing/download-data/] available
    on Github.

#3 Collaboration


A shared protocol will empower us to rapidly address societal issues
[https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375126831565697024] by facilitating more
collaboration towards building creative solutions. Some powerful browser
extensions and web applications built on Twitter's private API offer a glimpse
into the sort of innovation a protocol would unleash. 

 * Twemex [https://twemex.app/] is a browser extension that "replaces the
   distracting Twitter sidebar and surfaces insightful tweets."
 * Hive.one [https://hive.one/] uses a mathematical approach
   [https://www.notion.so/About-15b9db2c1f414cf998c5abc58b715176] to helps users
   identify who, and what information should be considered credible.
 * Check my echo chamber [https://www.polarizationlab.com/echo-checker] measures
   the strength of your political echo chamber 
 * Twitterexplorer [https://twitterexplorer.org/] is an interface that helps
   computational social scientists. explore Twitter data through interactive
   network visualizations
   [https://blog.twitterexplorer.org/post/harpers_letter/].
 * MentionMapp [https://mentionmapp.com/] allows you to visualize and explore
   interactions to help find new hashtags and followers.

#4 Censorship-resistance


Dorsey believes
[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-interview] social
media can be more like Bitcoin, and an open protocol like Bluesky will help
bring this vision to life. His current goal in life is to "remove as much as I
can the corporateness of our companies and find better intersections with the
open-source community."

He sees Twitter gradually evolving into a platform that "will have none of the
restrictions that you see on Twitter."

> "I know that there’s a lot of you out there who disagree with a lot of actions
that Twitter has taken. I know there’s a lot of you out there who disagree with
our policies and the way we have evolved them. I appreciate that and recognize
it. I also recognize the fact that there is an incentive and a corporate
incentive and a business incentive that is different than what might be needed
for global communication and for a public conversation." - Jack Dorsey
[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-interview]
Open Questions


A few questions I'll be keeping in mind as I observe Bluesky's progress:

 1. What will Twitter's business model look like if they successfully transition
    to being the client of an open protocol? 
 2. To what extent will this standard be embraced by other social media giants?
 3. Will Twitter succeed in creating a diverse and thriving open-source
    community around the Bluesky standard?
 4. Do those who are worried this open vision will create safe havens for
    extremists
    [https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/] 
    have valid concerns?
 5. Will someone else build a better social protocol? Ric Burton is convinced
    [https://ricburton.substack.com/p/social-networks-and-sociable-protocols] a
    revolution in social media will come from "come from young teams with
    nothing to lose and a totally new perspective."Project Liberty
    [https://www.coindesk.com/frank-mccourt-social-media-project-liberty-decentralized-protocol] 
    could be a credible competitor.

Conclusion


Bluesky is one of the most important new initiatives in social media. If the
team succeeds in manifesting Dorsey's vision, it will provide humanity with the
infrastructure necessary for us to build a healthier social media ecosystem. 

Instead of relying on governments or corporations to address the issues with
social media, we must embrace an alternative well-tested approach. Global
collaboration around open-source standards. Open to anyone who wishes to
contribute. Transparent for the entire world to observe. 

> "So really excited about the work [on Bluesky]. I think it's an entirely new
chapter for the Internet and for our company. It's going to challenge us in all
the right ways, and I think it aligns our incentives to make sure that we are
building a durable and enduring business, and that we're addressing a bunch of
the concerns we see with social media in this moment and also some that will
likely occur in the future." – Jack Dorsey
