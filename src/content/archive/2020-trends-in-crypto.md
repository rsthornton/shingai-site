As Bitcoin hits fresh all time highs
[https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxjbw/bitcoin-price-just-hit-its-ath?utm_content=1606751282&utm_medium=social&utm_source=MOTHERBOARD_facebook] 
and we are starting to see renewed mainstream interest in crypto, I'd like to
reflect on some of the important long-term trends that I'm paying attention to.

Increased Institutional Adoption


Fidelity Investments has observed increased interest
[https://decrypt.co/49344/fidelity-bitcoins-institutional-adoption-is-having-a-watershed-moment] 
from hedge funds, ultra high net worth individuals, and family offices, and the
firm's chief strategist is managing a Bitcoin Index Fund
[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822414/000182241420000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml]
. Their research group has published an investment thesis
[https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/aspirational-store-of-value] on
Bitcoin as an aspirational store of value system along with a survey of
institutional investors
[https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/institutional-investors-digital-asset-survey.pdf] 
showing "greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new
investable asset class."

ARK Invest's CEO Cathy Wood has observed
[https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-could-hit-500-000-according-to-ark-invests-catherine-wood-51605906264] 
institutions gradually increasing their cryptocurrency exposure from a half
percent allocation to around five percent. ARK has published two comprehensive
white papers on Bitcoin as a novel economic institution
[https://ark-invest.com/white-papers/bitcoin-part-one/], and as an investment
[https://ark-invest.com/white-papers/bitcoin-part-two/]. 

Computer software company Microstrategy added $425 million
[https://www.coindesk.com/microstrategys-425m-bitcoin-bet-elevating-firms-profile-say-executives] 
worth of BTC to its corporate treasury, and payments giant Square purchased 
$50M
worth of BTC [https://www.coindesk.com/square-50m-bitcoin-buy]. There are also
signs of increased institutional interest in Ethereum, as Grayscale investments
is experiencing a sharp increase in demand
[https://twitter.com/Sonnenshein/status/1324852136522469377] for their publicly
quoted Ethereum investment vehicle [https://grayscale.co/ethereum-trust/]. 

Demand for Decentralized Finance 


Decentralized Finance
[https://multicoin.capital/2020/11/24/the-defi-stack/?mc_cid=4ac674e100](DeFi
[https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/]) refers to an ecosystem of
decentralized protocols and applications that allows users to engage in digital
payments, trade cryptoassets, borrow and lend money, and earn interest on
deposits by relying on smart contracts instead of centralized financial
intermediaries. DeFi users also have access to advanced financial infrastructure
such as derivatives [https://dydx.exchange/]/options [https://www.hegic.co/] 
trading, synthetic assets [https://www.synthetix.io/], and investment fund
management software [https://melonprotocol.com/].

The total value locked in DeFi has grown from $690 million to ~$14 billion over
the course of this year, and the number of DeFi users has grown from ~100,000 to
~984,360. Decentralized exchanges have seen a surge in activity
[https://duneanalytics.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics] while decentralized prediction
markets like Augur
[https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/open-finance/derivatives/augur-v2-open-interest]
, Omen [https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/omen-stats], and Polymarket
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rorymurray/2020/10/19/polymarket-raises-massive-4-million-round-from-polychain-naval-ravikant-other-notable-investors/?sh=7e392bec62ea] 
are also gaining traction.

[https://www.duneanalytics.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics]New Markets for NFTs


> NFTs, or "Non-Fungible Tokens," are one-of-a-kind tokens that represent a unique
good or asset. They’ve been called “crypto collectibles” because, much like
trading cards, NFTs can be bought and sold by collectors. -Foundation
[https://foundation.app/blog/nfts-are-transforming-the-digital-art-world]
Developers and creators are collaborating to unlock an entirely new design space
for crypto with NFTs. 

Visual artists are creating unique digital pieces which can be traded on open
marketplaces such as Rarible [https://rarible.com/] and SuperRare
[https://superrare.co/], and displayed in virtual
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C8gHZOma4I] art
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALEfjcSmAb4] galleries
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRGtReFiM8Q]. Musicians, including grammy award
winner RAC, are issuing Audio NFTs
[https://coopahtroopa-eth.medium.com/musicians-meet-audio-nfts-aa495cfd2996] 
which give users access to limited physical goods
[https://twitter.com/RAC/status/1320525732519444480] and some innovative forms
of digital art [https://twitter.com/RAC/status/1331681095138435072]. 

Legacy gaming companies including Atari
[https://www.atari.com/iconic-atari%EF%B8%8F-properties-are-headed-to-the-revolutionary-blockchain-based-gaming-metaverse-the-sandbox/] 
and Ubisoft
[https://decrypt.co/46997/ubisoft-backed-blockchain-rpg-lets-players-fork-the-game]
, along with cryptonative projects like Axie Infinity
[https://axieinfinity.com/] are using NFTs to represent video game assets. 
Dapper Labs' NBA Top Shot
[https://www.coindesk.com/nba-top-shot-samsung-galaxy-store] generated >$2
million from over 17,000 users in the beta of their NFT collectible game. 

The number of people experimenting with NFTs is growing at a steady rate, and
there are no signs of this trend slowing down.

NFT Issuers [https://www.duneanalytics.com/jbrukh/nft-issuers]The Dawn of
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations


> A DAO is an entity that lives on the internet and exists autonomously, but also
heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton
itself cannot do. – Vitalik Buterin
[https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/]
DAOs represent a radically new way of organizing labor and raising/allocating
capital. They are a potent tool for creating organizations with more efficiency
and transparency, lower barriers to entry, and more equitable ownership
structures. Ralph Merkle even believes they could help us design new and
improved forms of democracy [https://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf]. 

There are ~11,698 DAO members managing ~$186M worth of assets
[https://deepdao.io/] in the top 88 DAOs being tracked by DeepDAO
[https://deepdao.substack.com/p/introducing-deep-dao-analytics-for]. 

While the original DAO experiment
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)] in 2016 collapsed before
the potential of DAOs could be demonstrated, 2020 has witnessed a flurry of
activity in the space as eager experimenters who have learned from the past are
proving out the merits of the concept.

Looking Ahead 


During the last bull market, it was obvious that cryptoassets were bubbling
primarily due to speculation and hype. While there's still plenty of that this
time around, the difference is that we are now seeing significant progress in
terms of adoption and the development of useful applications that are starting
to find product market fit. The price action is important and exciting, but
focusing on long term-trends is the best way to find the signal in all of the
noise.
